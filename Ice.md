At exactly 3:17 p.m., the vending machine decided it was a god. It accepted your money, pondered your desire for salt and crunch, and then—mercilessly—kept the chips for itself. Somewhere inside its humming metal ribs, a single snack rested diagonally, mocking you. You pressed the button again, as if devotion might help. It did not.
Outside, a pigeon with one brave foot and one philosophical outlook judged everyone equally. A breeze carried the smell of coffee and regret. Someone laughed too loudly three blocks away. The day continued, unbothered by your small tragedy.
Eventually, you walked on. The vending machine won the battle, but not the war. You would remember this.
